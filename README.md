  🐭 I am currently developing the concept of onchain romanticism—a practice that reimagines blockchain transactions as a medium for personal expression, beyond their utilitarian roles in monetary transfer or value exchange. My work engages blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and digital poetry to soften the edges of onchain capitalism and introduce intimacy and emotional resonance into distributed systems. <br/>
